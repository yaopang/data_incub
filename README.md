# data incubator project proposal

The project aims to explore the lyric style of popular music in recent years. The problem I try to solve is how many different categories of lyric currently existing in the pop music industry and establish a metric to measure the lyric style of an artist.  I was able to retrieve the titles of the most streamed 18,000 songs on Spotify from the past year. With the help of a website called "LyricWiki", I was able to scrap the website for 4,300 lyrics of these popular titles. 
To do a quick exploratory analysis of the datasets, I used the counts of vocabularies to represent the features of these famous titles, and generate a similar feature set with lyrics only by 'Drake'. By comparison, I found significant overlaps for some words like 'know', 'love, 'get', and etc and a fair amount of unique words for each set.  As one of the iconic artist in the pop music industry, it is no surprise that lyrics by 'Drake' share similar usage of words with other popular music. However, in order to further explore the similarity and difference between artists, we need a more sophisticated feature representation of the lyrics. The next step of this project would be applying TF-IDF model for lyrics clustering and represents the lyric style of an artist with generated clusters.
